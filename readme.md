### A very simple shell script to automate push n pull a repo.

Make sure to replace "/path/to/your/repository" with the actual path to your Git repository and main with the branch you want to pull from and push to, if it's different.

To make the script executable, run:
> chmod +x git_sync.sh

You are then able to execute the script from the terminal:
> ./git_sync.sh
